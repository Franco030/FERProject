--- VM ---
The choice to have a static VM instance is not necessarily a sound engineering choice for a real language implementation.
It gives the host more flexibility if we do explicitly take a VM pointer and pass it around.
That way, the host app can control when and where memory for the VM is allocated, run multiple VMs in parallel, etc.
What we have is similar to singleton pattern, where we use the same instance for every chunk.

We may store ip in a local variable. It gets modified so often during execution that we want the C compiler to keep it in a register
