--- Strings ---
Add escape characters?
Add access to individual characters, the string's length, changing case, splitting, joining, searching...

--- Conditionals ---
Maybe add conditional expressions like ?:
Maybe add switch statements?

The grammar should be:

switchStmt     → "switch" "(" expression ")"
                 "{" switchCase* defaultCase? "}" ;
switchCase     → "option" expression ":" statement* ;
defaultCase    → "default" ":" statement* ;

--- loops ---
Add break; and continue; Both should be jumps I think.

--- functions ---
Native function calls are fast in part because we don’t validate that the call passes as many arguments as the function expects.
We really should, or an incorrect call to a native function without enough arguments could cause the function to read uninitialized memory.
Add arity checking.

--- classes ---
Make classes more complex by adding methods similar to dunder methods in python, instead of __str__(), use something like ~str()
How do we remove a field from an instance. We can set a field's value to nil, but the entry in the hash table is still there.
