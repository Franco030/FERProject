--- Strings ---
Add access to individual characters, the string's length, changing case, splitting, joining, searching... this is from stdlib I guess


--- functions ---
Native function calls are fast in part because we don’t validate that the call passes as many arguments as the function expects.
We really should, or an incorrect call to a native function without enough arguments could cause the function to read uninitialized memory.
Add arity checking.

--- classes ---
Make classes more complex by adding methods similar to dunder methods in python, instead of __str__(), use something like ~str()
How do we remove a field from an instance. We can set a field's value to nil, but the entry in the hash table is still there.
